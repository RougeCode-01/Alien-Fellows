  - 'Hey there, PAL, I''m DJ RENTOID. '
  - I hear a lot of people hate on LANDLORDS, but I think that's REDUCTIVE and REFLECTIVE
    OF A NARROW WORLD VIEW.
  - MAINSTREAM MEDIA happily encourages the WORKING CLASS to hate the LANDLORD CLASS.
  - It's how your government SHIFTS BLAME for the effects of INFLATION -
  - from the BUEROCRACY ERODING YOUR RIGHTS AND SAVINGS to middle-class PROPERTY
    OWNERS.
  - This used to be a nice place to live, man - but our TOWERING BUEROCRACY has enforced
    UNCHECKED IMMIGRATION while RAISING TAXES -
  - Thus we are forced to live CRAMPED TOGETHER in SQUALOR, unable to improve our
    lot -
  - Wasting all our EFFORT AND MONEY on BLOATED SOCIAL PROGRAMS that have no ACCOUNTABILITY.
